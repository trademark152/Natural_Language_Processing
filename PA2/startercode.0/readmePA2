Perceptron model to classify reviews
2 models: vanilla and average
1) Big idea:
- Training:
  ~ Define paths to each file to know the true label, text content and file name
  ~ Tokenize input document --> create a document with name, text content, label, word frequency
  ~ Initialize weights and bias for each kind of models: w={word1:weight1, word2:weight2...}, b={word1:bias1,...}
  ~ Loop through each document, loop through each word in document
    ` summation of weightWord * wordFrequecy
    ` take product of summation with true label of that doc, check the sign
    ` if smaller than 0 then update weightWord += label*wordFrequency, biasWord += label
  ~ write weight and bias to output file
  ~ Run shell command
  
- Testing:
  ~ Specify which models to use: Vanilla or Average, import model file and extract model parameters
  ~ Locate paths to testing files (to know the true label)
  ~ Tokenize input document --> create a document with name, text content, label, word frequency
  ~ Classify each document by multiplying weights with frequency: 1 POS or TRU, -1 then NEG or DEC
  ~ Run shell command
